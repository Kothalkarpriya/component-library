- Component Library is created to use its bits and bytes into our Macro and micro projects, which will reduce our work to create component again, It's ready to use parts we can use and Create our website.
- We just need to import the file using @import command in css as 

- @import url('https://component-library-priya.netlify.app/css/style.css')

- and we can use components into our website.

- Or else we can link to html page using link tag:

- Inlcude the link into href attribute as : href="https://component-library-priya.netlify.app/css/style.css" and specify the relation as we do with css files to link with html page  as : rel="stylesheet".

- After Including the link tag into head tag, we can directly copy the code given for different component and paste it into our page and We are able to use it.
